# PocketToots

A Firefox extension that saves your Mastodon bookmarks to Pocket and adds a
link (ðŸ¦£ in the bottom left corner) to the source toot to the Pocket item's

In order to do this, it creates a *PocketToots* folder in you bookmarks, which
it uses to link pocket items with source toots.

## Configuration

click on â˜°, *Add-ons and themes*, *PocketToots*, *Preferences*, type the URL
(e.g. "https://mastodon.social/") into the field and hit *Save*.
